  Quick Fashion – Smart Wardrobe & Outfit Manager
About the Project:
Quick Fashion is a project I built to solve a pretty common problem — figuring out what to wear! 
Most of us have trouble remembering what clothes we already own, how to match items together, or what to wear for different events. 
On top of that, shopping for new clothes can be a hassle, especially when you’re browsing different stores and not sure what goes with what.

This project aims to simplify all of that by managing your wardrobe digitally using a well-structured database. 
It stores outfit info, gives suggestions based on your preferences and the occasion, and even helps you find similar clothes in nearby stores. 
It’s like having a smart assistant for your wardrobe!

Key Features:
Keep track of your wardrobe items
Suggest matching outfits based on color and occasion
Filter suggestions based on personal preferences
Check if an outfit or similar one is available in nearby stores

How the Database is Structured:

Users: Stores user information
Outfits: Links clothes into complete outfit combinations
